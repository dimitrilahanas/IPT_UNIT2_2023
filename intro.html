        <div class="right_content">
            <p>Japanese architecture is a rich and distinctive style that has captivated the world with its unique blend of tradition and innovation. Traditionally known for its temples and shrines, Japanese architecture has evolved drastically over the past couple of centuries. Originating from elevated wooden structures, sliding doors and tilted roofs, Japan’s modern architecture has become one of the most engaging and interesting forms of architecture to date. It cleverly encompassess its original roots to develop a new and inspiring form of art that the rest of the world could feed from. Although modern Japanese architecture is one of the most beautiful arts in the world, the history of how it became so beautiful is truly what sets it apart from other forms of architecture and art.</p>
        
            <p><u>Asuka and Nara Period (592-710)</u> - <br>The periods of Asuka and Nara struck the beginning of Japanese architecture as we know it today. Architecture predominantly in these periods were vastly influenced by China and Korea. During this period great building structures and sculptures in the “Asuku style” were erected - one of the most notable structures being “The Seven Temples”, built in 690. Temple construction was introduced into Japan in 538 due to the introduction of Buddhism.</p>

            <p><u>Mediaeval Period (1185-1603)</u> -<br>As trading with China increased during this period, so did the influence they had on Japanese architecture. Japan saw the rise of the samurai class and the establishment of a feudal system, with regional warlords known as daimyo holding significant power. The architectural landscape adapted to accommodate the needs and preferences of these feudal lords. With that came extraordinary temples and statues built in honour of their new leaders. A famous structure in this period being the “Great Buddha Hall” which had previously been burnt down and rebuilt. This structure had a unique aesthetic to it sharing similarities to Chinese architecture in the same time period.</p>
