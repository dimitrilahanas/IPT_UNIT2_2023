                <p>Japanese architecture is a rich and distinctive style that has captivated the world with its unique blend of tradition and innovation. Traditionally known for its temples and shrines, Japanese architecture has evolved drastically over the past couple of centuries. Originating from elevated wooden structures, sliding doors and tilted roofs, Japan’s modern architecture has become one of the most engaging and interesting forms of architecture to date. It cleverly encompassess its original roots to develop a new and inspiring form of art that the rest of the world could feed from. Although modern Japanese architecture is one of the most beautiful arts in the world, the history of how it became so beautiful is truly what sets it apart from other forms of architecture and art.</p>

                    <p><u>Asuka and Nara Period (592-710)</u> - <br>The periods of Asuka and Nara struck the beginning of Japanese architecture as we know it today. Architecture predominantly in these periods were vastly influenced by China and Korea. During this period great building structures and sculptures in the “Asuku style” were erected - one of the most notable structures being “The Seven Temples”, built in 690. Temple construction was introduced into Japan in 538 due to the introduction of Buddhism.</p>

                <p><u>Mediaeval Period (1185-1603)</u> - <br>As trading with China increased during this period, so did the influence they had on Japanese architecture. Japan saw the rise of the samurai class and the establishment of a feudal system, with regional warlords known as daimyo holding significant power. The architectural landscape adapted to accommodate the needs and preferences of these feudal lords. With that came extraordinary temples and statues built in honour of their new leaders. A famous structure in this period being the “Great Buddha Hall” which had previously been burnt down and rebuilt. This structure had a unique aesthetic to it sharing similarities to Chinese architecture in the same time period.</p>
        
                <p><u>Modern Times (1986-Present)</u> - <br>The modern time period welcomed foreign residents with open hands. It was a time where technology had advanced enough to allow for enough structures to be built to house new populations. It was a chance for Japan to expand their country's wealth and create more opportunities for its people. Residential housing, trading houses and churches for foreign residents were built. These buildings portrayed resemblance of western-style architecture in an attempt to attract Europeans.</p>
                <p>As technology grew, so did the size of Japan. The population was bigger than ever, housing was on demand and so was work. Japan had almost lost its original architectural style early into this period, and its local citizens began to notice. As Japan’s focus had shifted from its architectural beauty and stuck to traditional western buildings, its cities began to appear boring and dull. It did not help that due to the wars a lot of old traditional buildings were lost. But its local citizens still demanded that traditional Japanese architecture was to become a dominant feature in their cities.</p>
                <p>So it did, not only was traditional Japanese architecture being brought back into the city but a new innovative look had begun. Architects took free rein on this opportunity generating new traditional Japanese inspired designs. To this day Japanese architecture is further advancing and greets the rest of the world with a new, beautiful and innovative way of architecture. Some notable extraordinary modern Japanese architecture include, Bird’s nest Atami, Nakagin Capsule Tower, Tower of Winds and Leek House</p>
