        <p><u>Born:</u> 4th September 1913<br><u>Place of Birth:</u> Osaka, Japan<br><u>Age:</u> 91 (death)<br><u>Past away:</u> 22nd March 2005<br><u>Occupation:</u> Architect</p>
    
        <p>Kenzo Tange was one of the eldest architects contributing to Japan’s magnificent rebirth. His visionary designs and innovative approach to architecture played a vital role in shaping Japan’s urban landscape during the postwar era. Tange’s early years were driven by his deep appreciation for both traditional Japanese architecture and the emerging modernist movements sweeping through Europe. </p>
    
        <p>Tange’s population drastically grew during the rebuild of Japan after World War II. Working as an urban planner he repaid his home of Hiroshima by assisting in its urban planning. Throughout this post war era his architecture excelled, gaining international attention in 1949 when his design for the Hiroshima Peace Center and Memorial Park were selected for an award.</p>

        <p>On August 6th, 1945, a B-29 bomber dropped the first atomic bomb in history over Hiroshima, Japan, targeting the intersection of bridges over the Honkawa and Motoyasu rivers. Kenzo Tange was commissioned with a challenge of designing the reconstruction of one of his home's significant areas, the Hiroshima Peace Center and Memorial Park.</p>

        <p>Tange absorbed inspiration from ancient Japanese traditions to rebuild this magnificent site. Incomperating traditions such as Japanese sun-screens and the modular arrangement of the facade. Throughout the build many other artists engaged in assisting Tange transform this once beautiful space into a magnificent memorial area; being influenced to incorporate pillars to hold the structure together. He seeked the use of materials accessible in Japan, thus resulting in the structures to be built in reinforced concrete.</p>
    
        <p>These structures to date still stand in its beauty, attracting a significant number of tourists to Tange’s home of Hiroshima. In term earning Kenzo Tange with the Hiroshima Peace Prize, an award that honours those who contribute to advances in world peace, culture and education.</p>
