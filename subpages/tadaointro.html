        <p><u>Born:</u> 13th September 1941<br><u>Place of Birth:</u> Osaka, Japan<br><u>Age:</u> 81<br><u>Occupation:</u> Architect</p>
    
        <p>Tadao Ando is a Japanese architect whose approach to his work is typically categorised as critical religion. Ando was born and raised in Japan, religion was an important aspect of his and his family's life. This aspect of his life has heavily contributed to his architecture style. Commonly known for his simplistic buildings, preferring to leave big blank areas and plain walls, associating it with deeper meanings.</p>
    
        <p>This form of architecture has been categorised by the religious term Zen. It has heavily influenced Ando’s work and has become a distinguishing mark. In order to practise the idea of simplicity, This is achieved through the use of concrete, providing a sense of cleanliness and weightlessness.</p>

        <p>Church of The Light is one of Tadao Ando’s signature pieces. It cleverly incorporates the religious idea of Zen while creating an innovative religious space. Ando’s goal was to incorporate the theme of dual nature of existence, which he successfully achieved. By using his trademark material of plain concrete, Ando was able to incorporate a small aspect of nature but yet make it so powerful.</p>

        <p>The church sits tall on top of a hill in Osaka, Japan. It includes cuts in a wall shaped as a cross allowing light and nature to pass through. This creates a beautiful innovative light source as seen in the image on this page. Ando cleverly utilises his style of Zen to turn a dull room into something extraordinary full of emotion and mysteries.</p>
