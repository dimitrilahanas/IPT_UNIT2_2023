        <p><u>Born:</u> 8th April 1934<br><u>Place of Birth:</u> Kaine, Japan<br><u>Age:</u> 73 (death)<br><u>Past away:</u> 12th October 2007<br><u>Occupation:</u> Architect</p>
    
        <p>Kisho Kurokawa was a renowned architect of Japan’s modern era, making profound contributions to the nation’s architectural landscape. Influenced by traditional Japanese architecture and the modernist movements in Europe, Kurokawa’s work excelled in the 20th century. </p>
    
        <p>Kurokawa was well known for his assistance within the Metabolist movement, presenting himself as both a crucial member and valuable mentor. This movement revolved around the idea of imperfections and change, in a move to bring back a more natural aspect to architecture.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>The Nakagin Capsule Tower is one of Kurokawa’s most astonishing and unique architecture. Unfortunately in the present it is permanently closed, this capsule tower was the first of its kind in the entire world. Designed after World War II, where housing was needed ASAP, these capsules were utilised for housing and offices. These forms of housing enabled Japan to keep up with its demand from locals drastically affected by the war at a fraction of the cost.</p>

        </div>

        <p>This form of unseen architecture struck the rest of the world. It was their first insight on the innovative country of Japan and illustrated Japan’s community's strength, being able to bounce back from such a significant event with ease.</p>
    
        <p>Even though it looked extremely different from other Japanese architecture it still honoured many ancient Japanese aspects. This was predominantly seen through the materials used. Wooden panels were used for the inner section (the area where residents would go up to their apartments) and reinforced concrete, seen in many Japanese architecture today, was used for the apartments themselves.</p>

        <p>Circular windows were used in conjunction with innovative technology seen from within the rooms. Giving back to Japan’s innovative culture and difference to the rest of the world.</p>
